		<h1>BETA Via Rail Consist Details</h1>
		<p>The drop-down box allows you to filter the list by train number.</p>
		<p>The column marked as "SeqNum" allows you to tell the order of the cars on the train. The numbers don't actually refer to the position of the car in the consist, but smaller numbers come ahead of larger numbers.</p>
		<p>Note that this is an <b>early beta</b> webpage, and quirks such as duplicate entries for the same train car should be expected.</p>
